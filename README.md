This "htagweb" module is the official way to expose htag's apps on the web. 

**Important note**
On the web, the server can handle many clients : so, it's not possible to handle each tag instances per user. SO there are 1 limitation compared to classical htag runners which comes with htag.

 - ~~there can be only one managed instance of a htag class, per user~~ (it's the case in classical runners too)
 - and tag instances doesn't live as long as the runner lives (when you hit F5, it will be destroyed/recreated). So, keeping states must be done thru the tag.state / tag.root.state (which is the session of the user).

So developping a htag app which work the same on desktop and on the web, should manage its states in tag.state / tag.root.state ;-)

 ## Features

 * based on [starlette](https://pypi.org/project/starlette/)
 * multiple ways to handle sessions (file, mem, etc ...)
 * compatible with **uvloop** !!!
 * compatible with multiple gunicorn/uvicorn/webworkers !!!
 * compatible with **tag.update()**
 * works on gnu/linux, ios or windows !
 * real starlette session available (in tag.state, and starlette request.session)
 * compatible with oauth2 authent ( [authlib](https://pypi.org/project/Authlib/) )
 * 'parano mode' (can aes encrypt all communications between client & server ... to avoid mitm'proxies on ws exchanges)

## Roadmap / futur

 - ? replace starlette by fastapi ?
 - the double rendering (double init creation) is not ideal. But great for SEO bots. Perhaps I could find a better way (and let only one rendering, but how ?!) ?!
 - more unittests !!!
 - better logging !!!


## Examples

A "hello world" could be :

```python
from htag import Tag

class App(Tag.div):
    def init(self):
        self+= "hello world"

from htagweb import AppServer
AppServer( App ).run()
```

or, with gunicorn (in a `server.py` file, as following):

```python
from htag import Tag

class App(Tag.div):
    def init(self):
        self+= "hello world"

from htagweb import AppServer
app=AppServer( App )
```

and run server :

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornH11Worker -b localhost:8000 --preload server:app
```

See a more advanced example in [examples folder](https://github.com/manatlan/htagweb/tree/master/examples)

```bash
python3 examples/main.py
```

# Standalone module can act as server

The module can act as "development server", providing a way to quickly run any htag class in a browser. And let you browse current `*.py` files in a browser.

```bash
$ python3 -m htagweb
```
htagweb will look for an "index:App" (a file `index.py` (wich contains a htag.Tag subclass 'App').), and if it can't found it : expose its own htag app to let user browse pythons files in the browser (`/!\`)

or

```bash
$ python3 -m htagweb main:App
```
if you want to point the "/" (home path) to a file `main.py` (wich contains a htag.Tag subclass 'App').
